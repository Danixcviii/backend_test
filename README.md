# backend_test
Backend test with python 
* Analyze the code present in the test
* What does this code do?
    - This code defines a AWS Lambda that uses others lambdas to get information about, 
the products offered by a vending machine (type of product 'I guess', available amound, width, etc.. (I guess again)),
using a user_id and a device_id.
* Which segments would you change, why?
    - If I had to just change a section of it to improve performance but readability, I would change the section between line 122 to 142, it could be done on a single for loop.
* Could you make a better version?
* Now do it and enjoy it
